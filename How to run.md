The Game/Main class will allow you to run with preset teams or choose your own teams and rune sets. 
Teams cannot have repeat Monsters (ex. Team 1 cannot have two Lushens, even if there are two different rune sets)


The Game/Auto_Play class is currently set up to run every possible team composition against each other and print the four best teams when it is finished. 
Press enter at any time to pause the program and view the best teams at the time. Ending the program will also print the top four teams at the time. 
The program will only run with default rune sets and NO leader skills to help limit the number of simulations


The Game/Test_One_Team allows you to create a Team and simulate it in a battle against every other possible Team


The GUI/Runes class is an easier way to create, edit, and delete the rune classes. 
You will first be asked to enter a Monster name and rune set number then choose what action to complete. 
The program will handle creating, editing,deleting, and writing to the file.
