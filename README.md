All characters, names, effects, abilities, runes, etc. belong to Summoners War: Sky Arena and Com2uS Studios.


This is a personal project I developed to help further my programming skills.


All code is written by me unless stated otherwise


Read "How to run.txt" for a description of each runnable class


There are currently 22 monsters implemented (found in Monsters/Monster database.csv). Feel free to make more if you know how and want to. 
If you do, read "How to create a new Monster.txt" for instructions. All characters should be accurate as of December 10, 2023.
Each Monster has at least one rune set already but feel free to make your own.


Only leader skills that are active in PvP battles (ex. Arena, Siege Battle) are implemented (The program will not differentiate between different PvP modes,
meaning skills only active in the Arena can be active at the same time as skills only active in Siege Battle).


Profile skills are not implemented.


At the time of writing this, I have not implemented artifact sub-effects.


All Monsters are level 40 awakened (2A where applicable) and have max upgraded skills for simplicityâ€™s sake
