* All characters, names, effects, abilities, runes, etc. belong to Summoners War: Sky Arena and Com2uS Studios.


* Java 22 with Preview features or higher is required


* This is a personal project I developed to help further my programming skills.


* All code is written by me unless stated otherwise


* Read "How to run.txt" for a description of each runnable class


* There are currently 28 monsters implemented (found [here](src/Monsters/Monster%20database.csv)).
  Feel free to make more if you know how and want to.
  If you do, read [this](How%20to%20create%20a%20new%20Monster.md) for instructions.
  All characters should be accurate as of October 11, 2024.
  Each Monster has at least one rune set already but feel free to make your own.


* Only leader skills that are active in PvP battles (ex. Arena, Siege Battle) are implemented (The program will not differentiate between different 
  PvP modes, meaning skills only active in the Arena can be active at the same time as skills only active in Siege Battle).


* Profile skills are not implemented, and I have no plan of implementing them in the future.


* Artifact sub-effects have not been implemented, but I plan to do so later.


* All Monsters are level 40 awakened (2A where applicable) and have max upgraded skills for simplicityâ€™s sake


* Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDcFJSx4CX0) video for a short video of the project (Slightly outdated)
